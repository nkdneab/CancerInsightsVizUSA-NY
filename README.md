### Overview

This project leverages data analytics and visualization techniques to provide insights into cancer incidence and death rates across the United States and New York. Using Tableau for interactive visualizations, the project aims to identify key patterns and correlations to inform policy and healthcare strategies.

### Features

- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Explore relationships between variables such as population demographics, median income, and cancer-related deaths.
- **Geographic Insights**: Focus on trends at national, state, and county levels, with detailed analysis of New York.
- **Visualization Tools**: Tableau dashboards offer intuitive, interactive charts for stakeholders.
- **Strategic Recommendations**: Insights designed to guide decision-making in public health and resource allocation.

### Data Sources

The project utilizes data from:

- Population estimates (as of July 1).
- Cancer incidence and death statistics.
- Socioeconomic data (e.g., median income, education levels).

### Objectives

1. Provide actionable insights into cancer trends.
2. Identify socioeconomic factors influencing cancer outcomes.
3. Develop user-friendly Tableau dashboards for visualization.

### Tools and Technologies

- **Tableau**: Primary tool for data visualization.
- **R/Python**: For data preprocessing and statistical analysis.
- **Excel/CSV**: For structured data storage and manipulation.


### Dashboard

The dashboard is available on Tableau Public [here](https://10ay.online.tableau.com/#/site/jtrit/views/Data-DrivenInsightsintoCancerIncidenceandDeathAnalyticsandVisualizationsforStrategicOpportunitiesinAmericaandNewYork/3-LevelMapDrillDowns?:embed=n&:iid=5&:origin=card_share_link). It allows users to filter data by region, state, and county, focusing on cancer-related metrics such as incidence rates, death rates, and the mortality-to-incidence ratio. With interactive features, users can explore regional trends and drill down to state and county levels for deeper analysis.

This Tableau Public dashboard [here](https://10ay.online.tableau.com/#/site/jtrit/views/Data-DrivenInsightsintoCancerIncidenceandDeathAnalyticsandVisualizationsforStrategicOpportunitiesinAmericaandNewYork/PearsonCorrelationDashboard?:embed=n&:iid=6&:origin=card_share_link) visualizes Pearson correlation coefficients for various socioeconomic and health metrics, such as death rates, incidence rates, median income, and poverty levels, across different U.S. regions. Users can interactively click on correlation values to dynamically update scatterplots and explore relationships between variables in specific regions. This tool is designed for intuitive data exploration and deeper analysis of health disparities.

### Key Insights

### 1. Regional Trends
- The **Northeast** has the highest cancer incidence rate (486.69), led by **New York** (498.29).
- The **South** shows the highest cancer death rate (188.76) and death-to-incidence ratio (0.422).

### 2. State Highlights
- **Kentucky** has the highest death (215.32) and incidence (512.7) rates in the South.
- **Washington County, NY**, reports the highest death rate (198.4) in the Northeast.

### 3. Correlations
- **Income:** Higher income correlates with lower death rates (-0.5068).
- **Poverty:** Poverty correlates with higher death rates (0.4534) and potential underreporting.

### 4. Healthcare Interventions
- **High-Risk Areas:** Focus on improved screening, treatment, and mobile clinics.
- **Low-Income Areas:** Target with affordable preventive programs.
- **Underserved Regions:** Expand healthcare access in high-poverty areas.
