# Data-Driven Insights into Cancer Incidence and Death

## Analytics and Visualizations for Strategic Opportunities in America and New York

### Overview

This project leverages data analytics and visualization techniques to provide insights into cancer incidence and death rates across the United States and New York. Using Tableau for interactive visualizations, the project aims to identify key patterns and correlations to inform policy and healthcare strategies.

### Features

- **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Explore relationships between variables such as population demographics, median income, and cancer-related deaths.
- **Geographic Insights**: Focus on trends at national, state, and county levels, with detailed analysis of New York.
- **Visualization Tools**: Tableau dashboards offer intuitive, interactive charts for stakeholders.
- **Strategic Recommendations**: Insights designed to guide decision-making in public health and resource allocation.

### Data Sources

The project utilizes data from:

- Population estimates (as of July 1).
- Cancer incidence and death statistics.
- Socioeconomic data (e.g., median income, education levels).

### Objectives

1. Provide actionable insights into cancer trends.
2. Identify socioeconomic factors influencing cancer outcomes.
3. Develop user-friendly Tableau dashboards for visualization.

### Tools and Technologies

- **Tableau**: Primary tool for data visualization.
- **R/Python**: For data preprocessing and statistical analysis.
- **Excel/CSV**: For structured data storage and manipulation.


### Dashboard

The dashboard is available on Tableau Public [here](https://10ay.online.tableau.com/#/site/jtrit/views/Data-DrivenInsightsintoCancerIncidenceandDeathAnalyticsandVisualizationsforStrategicOpportunitiesinAmericaandNewYork/3-LevelMapDrillDowns?:embed=n&:iid=5&:origin=card_share_link). It allows users to filter data by region, state, and county, focusing on cancer-related metrics such as incidence rates, death rates, and the mortality-to-incidence ratio. With interactive features, users can explore regional trends and drill down to state and county levels for deeper analysis.

### Key Insights

- Washington County has the highest average death rate (198.4).
- Strong correlations identified between median income and death rates in specific regions.
- **High-Study Counties**: Counties with higher socioeconomic metrics tend to show lower death rates, indicating the influence of education and income on health outcomes.
- **Population Density Impact**: Urban counties often show differing patterns in incidence and death rates compared to rural counties, suggesting resource accessibility and healthcare quality disparities.
- **Age Demographics**: Regions with higher elderly populations report elevated death rates, underlining the need for targeted interventions in these areas.
- **Income Disparities**: Significant gaps in outcomes are observed between high-income and low-income counties, calling for focused policy measures.
